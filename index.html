    <p>Hi! My name is Jenny. I'm a linguist turned front-end web developer. For the past 7 years I've worked at local agencies on B2B and non-profit projects. <a href="#portfolio">See some of my recent projects</a>.</p>  
    <p>
    I'm a thoughtful and resourceful person with a mind for creative problem-solving. Continuing to learn is important to me and I love figuring out how things work. That's why I was drawn to this industry. </p>

  <h2>Where are you from?</h2>
  <p>I was born and reared in the heart of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willamette_Valley">Willamette Valley</a>, aka Corvallis. I live in Portland now. I've spent some time in other places nearby like Vancouver (BC), San Juan Island, and other places farther away like Tokyo.</p>

  <h2>More about me</h2>
  <h3>What are your favorite hobbies?</h3>
  <p>I've always got myself busy with some kind of arts 'n' crafts project like linocutting, sewing, and dyeing. <!--Yep, I've got an <a href="#">Etsy</a>.--> I also enjoy gardening, hiking, and mushroom-hunting. Sometimes you'll see me looking scared on a skateboard or asleep at the movies.</p>

  <h3>What's your dream job?</h3>
  <p>Is there a job that involves front-end and some combination of my hobbies? That's my dream. So, I think I'll have to start my own business...selling my crafts made out of mushrooms...online.</p>

  <h3>What music have you been listening to lately?</h3>
  <p>Currently listening to Dead Moon. I like some of all sorts, but as I get older, I find myself sticking with the same old stuff. </p>
